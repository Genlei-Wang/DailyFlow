# Resource File Placeholder
# 
# In a real build, you would use `rsrc` or `goversioninfo` tool to embed:
# - Application icon (.ico)
# - Version information
# - Manifest file
#
# For GitHub Actions build, the manifest will be embedded during compilation.
#
# To generate rsrc.syso manually:
# 1. Install rsrc: go install github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest
# 2. Run: rsrc -manifest dailyflow.manifest -o rsrc.syso
